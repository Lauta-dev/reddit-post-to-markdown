Saving Reddit Posts in Markdown Format

Small things I did out of boredom.

Simply paste the Reddit post link in the text field and click 'Save Post.'

To save it, click 'Download MD File.'

pd: If you want to use this in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), I recommend installing the [Thumbnails](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-thumbnails) plugin.
